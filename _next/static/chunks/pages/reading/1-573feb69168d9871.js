Information regarding the development of Britain’s flora following glaciation can be found by studying the deposits of pollen and seed in peat, as well as by the use of radiocarbon dating. Tundra and moorland followed the retreating ice, which lead to phases of different tree species spreading from the south.

Oak and alder came after pine, then lime, elm, beech, and maple, all spreading northwards one after the other.

It was not a dense, impassable wildwood, but instead, an area similar to a park, kept up by wild herbivores eating the plants and grass. Throughout earlier interglacial periods, this may also have been the case in Britain, as creatures of the Palaeolithic era needed to roam large areas of grassland to survive. A variety of grassland plants continued to live there in the last interglacial, as according to pollen records.

In the early twentieth century, the American ecologist Frederic Clements pointed out that a succession of plant communities would develop after a disturbance such as a volcanic eruption, heavy flood, or forest fire. An abandoned field, for instance, will be invaded successively by herbaceous plants, shrubs, and trees, eventually becoming a forest.",(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),(0,a.jsx)("b",{children:"B"})," The first community in a succession is called a pioneer community, while the established community at the end of a succession is called a climax community. Pioneer and successional plant communities are said to change over periods of 1 to 500 years. These changes—in plant numbers and the mix of species are cumulative. Climax communities themselves change but over periods of time greater than about 500 years. The final stage of a succession is not predictable or of uniform composition. There is usually a good deal of turnover in species composition, even in a mature community. The nature of the climax community is influenced by the same factors that influence succession. Nevertheless, mature natural environments are usually in equilibrium. They change relatively little through time unless the environment itself changes. Clements and other early ecologists saw an almost lawlike regularity in the order of succession, but that has not been substantiated. A general trend can be recognized, but the details are usually unpredictable. Succession is influenced by many factors: the nature of the soil, exposure to sun and wind, regularity of precipitation, chance colonizations, and many other arbitrary processes.",(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),(0,a.jsx)("b",{children:"C"}),' For Clements, the climax community was a "superorganism," an organic entity. Even some authors who accepted the climax community concept rejected Clements\' characterization of it as a superorganism, and it is indeed a misleading metaphor. An ant colony may be legitimately called a superorganism because its communication system is so highly organized that the colony always works as a whole and appropriately according to the circumstances. But there is no evidence for such an interacting communicative network in a climax plant formation. Many authors prefer the term "association" to the term "community" in order to stress the looseness of the interaction.',(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),(0,a.jsx)("b",{children:"D"}),' Even less fortunate was the extension of this type of thinking to include animals as well as plants. This resulted in the "biome," a combination of coexisting flora and fauna. Though it is true that many animals are strictly associated with certain plants, it is misleading to speak of a "spruce-moose biome," for example, because there is no internal cohesion to their association as it would be with an organism. The spruce community is not substantially affected by either the presence or absence of moose. Indeed, there are vast areas of spruce forest without moose. The opposition to the Clementsian concept of plant ecology was initiated by Herbert Gleason, soon joined by various other ecologists. Their major point was that the distribution of a given species was controlled by the habitat requirements of that species and that therefore the vegetation types were a simple consequence of the ecologies of individual plant species.',(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),(0,a.jsx)("b",{children:"E"}),' With "climax," "biome," "superorganism," and various other technical terms for the association of animals and plants at a given locality being criticized, the term"ecosystem" was more and more widely adopted for the whole system of associated organisms together with the physical factors of their environment. Eventually, the energy-transforming role of such a system was emphasized. An ecologist is concerned primarily with the quantities of matter and energy that pass through a given ecosystem, and with the rates at which they do so.

They believed that the greater the diversity the more stable the ecosystem. Support for this idea came from the observation that long-lasting climax communities usually have more complex food webs and more species diversity than pioneer communities. Ecologists concluded that the apparent stability of climax ecosystems depended on their complexity. To take an extreme example, farmlands dominated by a single crop are so unstable that one year of bad weather or the invasion of a single pest can destroy the entire crop. In contrast, a complex climax community, such as a temperate forest, will tolerate considerable damage from weather to pests.",(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),(0,a.jsx)("b",{children:"G"})," The question of ecosystem stability is complicated, however. Stability can be defined as simply lack of change. In that case, the climax community would be considered the most stable, since, by definition, it changes the least over time. Alternatively, stability can be defined as the speed with which an ecosystem returns to a particular form following a major disturbance, such as a fire. This kind of stability is also called resilience. In that case, climax communities would be the most fragile and the least stable, since they can require hundreds of years to return to the climax state.",(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),(0,a.jsx)("b",{children:"H"})," Even the kind of stability which is defined as simple lack of change is not always associated with maximum diversity. At least in temperate zones, maximum diversity is often found in mid-successional stages, not in the climax community. Once a redwood forest matures, for example, the kinds of species and the number of individuals growing on the forest floor are reduced. In general, diversity, by itself, does not ensure stability.

In this test, children needed to learn how to use a machine in a two-step process.

Cole found the difficulty of 'integration' was greatly reduced here.",(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),"It seems that the same truth which Cole discovered can be extended to explain the deductive reasoning skills of young children.

When these factors are adjusted in order to prevent the inferential nature of the problem being affected, five-year-old children are able to successfully complete these tests as well as college students did in the Kendlers' test.",(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),"Hewson made two essential changes to the test in order to build on this idea. First, he replaced the button-pressing mechanism with drawers that a child could slide open and shut. This removed confusion on what to do with the original button apparatus from the first stage of training. Secondly, Hewson made sure that children understood that there was nothing special or magical about the marble which was used to successfully complete the second step of the task and get the reward.",(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),"This is important because a child cannot easily comprehend a mechanism in which a marble put into a hole can open a little door. It would then be safe to say that the child will not assume that any marble of similar size could be used the same way. But, to solve the problem, this assumption must be made. Hewson clearly demonstrated the functional equivalence of different marbles to the children by playing a 'swapping game.” Hewson's two modifications to the experiment led to a rise in success rates from 30 percent to 90 percent for five-year old children and from 35 percent to 72.5 per cent for four-year-olds. Strangely enough for three-year olds, Hewson’s changes did not lead to any improvement, and instead there was a slight drop in performance from the change. Hewson's experiments showedthat children faced with the Kendler apparatus experienced difficulty not related to reasoning, but to the nature of the tasks themselves, and that difficulty cannot be taken as proof that they are incapable of deductive reasoning.
