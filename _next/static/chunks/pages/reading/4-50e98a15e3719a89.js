By counting these, we can accurately state that, as of 2011, Methuselah was4,842 years old, meaning that it sprouted as a seedling in 2832 BC, centuries before the ancient Egyptians began building their pyramids. And that‟s just one fascinating fact about that well-known species of tree – the pine. Pines trees are native to most of the Northern Hemisphere.

They have numerous scales arranged in a spiral, with seeds (on the female) tucked within. As the cone opens, the seeds eventually fall out, mostly to be dispersed by the wind, or sometimes by birds. In some varieties, the cones remain closed until their binding resin is melted by forest fires.",(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),"This last fact – the need for wildfires for regeneration – is another fascinating aspect of many pine species. In fire-prone areas, it can result in extensive stands of pines, a good example being in „pine barrens‟.

Upon doing this, to the astonishment of all, 4,844 rings were counted, signifying that the tree was even older than Methuselah.

Deep inside, she parted company from her dive buddy to explore a tight passageway through which only one person could pass.

Most fatalities that have occurred are a result of breaking accepted protocols, where improperly trained and inadequately equipped divers take on caves well beyond their capabilities.

There are five major ones, all decided upon after extensive accident analysis (the breaking down of accident reports to find their most common causes). Firstly, a cave diver should be trained and experienced. This is done in carefully documented components, each dealing with increasingly complex facets of cave diving, and accompanied with relevant, dive time before progression onwards is allowed. The next rule is the same as with all diving, whether open-sea or cave. It concerns the maximum depths and the decompression stops needed to allow the release of dissolved nitrogen from the blood. This is all carefully calculated in a dive plan before entering the water, and every diver must strictly adhere to this.",(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),"The next two protocols each concern a vital piece of equipment. Firstly, a guide rope is an absolute necessity. This is secured at the cave entrance, and fed into the cave by the lead diver. Sufficient tension is always maintained, and often the rope is tied up at regular lengths within the cave interior to ensure this. In the event of a silt-out, all divers, in theory, can find this rope, using it to guide their way back to the cave entrance. Equally crucial are the lights. A diver without lights is effectively marooned, unable to go anywhere. Each diver is therefore required to have three independent sources: a primary, and two backups. These are checked under the water when entering the cave, and the protocol states that if even one of these fails, the dive is abandoned for all members of the team.",(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),"The final protocol is, in some ways, the most basic, and concerns the breathing gas. With no quick escape, the „rule of thirds‟ prevails. Here, one third of the gas is reserved for exploring into the cave, one third for retreating out of it, and one third as a reserve in the event of an emergency, or to support fellow divers. Most protocols suggest keeping each third in a separate air system, so that the loss of one – for example, due to a valve rupture – will not imperil the other two. Another variation is to ensure that these three separate systems are used equally, so that the remaining air is kept balanced. Again, this is a defence against the loss of one system, maximising the amount of air remaining for the return.",(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),(0,a.jsx)("br",{}),"By following all such protocols, the risk is minimised, so that cave diving, as far as can be proven with the limited statistics available, is said to be safer than driving a car. Yet, as the sad death of Agnes Milowka shows, lethal mishaps can always occur. The question to be asked then is why anyone would want to dive into cold, confined, pitch-dark, subterranean cave systems in the first place. The answer is supplied by a cave-diving leader: „You get to see things that human beings have never seen before. Nothing on Earth can compare to that.‟"]}),3==e&&(0,a.jsxs)("p",{className:"text-center p-1 pb-4 text-lg",children:[" ",(0,a.jsx)("b",{children:"Criminal Rehabilitation: A Difficult Issue"})]}),3==e&&(0,a.jsxs)("p",{children:["When convicted criminals have served long terms of imprisonment, it is obvious that, upon their release, one cannot necessarily expect them to be reformed and able to reintegrate into society.

This is different from probation, which is used instead of prison sentences, and consequently places greater restrictions upon the subject.

Upon ignoring any of these, an arrest warrant is issued, parole time is stopped, and there follows a parole violation hearing.
